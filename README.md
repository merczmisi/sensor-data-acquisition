# sensor-data-acquisition
This is the work of my dissertation. It is an iOS WatchKit application that enables you to collect sensor data from your phone and from your paired watch.

The ViewController.swift and the ViewControllerRecord.swift files are resposible for managing recordings on the phone. While in the InterfaceController.swift file is responsible for the records on the watch.
